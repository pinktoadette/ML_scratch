    "* CNN involves different layers.Each of the layer connects to each other, hence network!\n",
    "* Pooling: Pooling is  process to reduce spatial volume of an image. It can take the max of the pool or the average. The pool is consist of nxm\n",
    "* Filters: set of weights which are learned, such as edges of an image. These filters are what actually detects the pattern on an input.\n",
    "* Input: Input of a shape, such as (batch_size, height, width, depth)\n",
    "* Feedforward: \n",
    "* Backpropation: Calculate the error between prediced output and target and then update the weight values using gradient descent.\n",
    "* Activation function: sigmoid, tanh, ReLu, Leaky ReLu (has a kink in ReLu)\n",
    "* Loss function: it can be log-loss or "
