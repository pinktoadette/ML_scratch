# ML from scratch

This repo reproduces some of the common machine learning tools used. 

A common issue is most of us plug and chug params and tweak hyperparameters without knowing much.
This notebook is to reproduce basic tools. This is done so to learn mathematically what goes on in each of these tools. 

Some of these are from past lectures, homeworks, textbooks, anywhere I can find.
